# EmailGenerator

This application was created to play around with the new GitHub CLI feature.

- It generates an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.examplecompany.com
- With user interaction a department is being set and according to that the email is being generated
- A password with a fixed length of 8 is randomly created out of a character set
